MakeIndex is a content management system that generates static
content. Notably, I use it to make this page.  It does some other
stuff, too, like summarise the directory structure in an <em>xml</em>
site map that is compatible with Google, and any <em>.news</em> in
an <em>rss</em> feed. The source code is <em>POSIX.1</em>, so in
Windows, one needs to compile it with <em>DJGPP</em>, <em>MinGW</em>,
<em>etc</em>, and probably not <em>MSVC</em>.
